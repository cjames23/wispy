"""WSP server lifecycle finite-state machine.

This module implements the lifecycle FSM that gates request dispatch on
the WSP server's initialization state. The dispatcher consults
:meth:`LifecycleManager.admit` before invoking any handler; the result
tells the dispatcher whether to dispatch the request, emit a JSON-RPC
error, or terminate the process with a specific exit status.

State diagram (see ``design.md``)::

    UNINITIALIZED --initialize/success--> INITIALIZED
    UNINITIALIZED --any other method-->   UNINITIALIZED  (-32002)
    UNINITIALIZED --exit notification-->  EXITED         (status 1)

    INITIALIZED   --any registered method--> INITIALIZED (success/domain err)
    INITIALIZED   --initialize-->            INITIALIZED (-32600, caps kept)
    INITIALIZED   --shutdown/success-->      SHUTTING_DOWN
    INITIALIZED   --exit notification-->     EXITED      (status 1)

    SHUTTING_DOWN --any non-exit message--> SHUTTING_DOWN (-32600)
    SHUTTING_DOWN --exit notification-->    EXITED        (status 0)

The FSM itself does not perform I/O and never raises. ``admit`` returns
one of three :data:`AdmitDecision` variants:

* :class:`Allow` -- the dispatcher should look up the handler and run it.
* :class:`RejectWith` -- the dispatcher should emit the carried
  :class:`~wispy.protocol.JsonRpcError` (and skip handler dispatch).
* :class:`Exit` -- the runtime should drain pending writes and exit the
  process with the carried status code.

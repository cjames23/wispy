"""Entry point for ``python -m wispy --config <path>``.

Loads a WSP Config_File, builds a :class:`~wispy.registry.HandlerRegistry`
from its entries plus the built-in ``initialize``/``shutdown`` handlers,
and runs the stdio server. Config-time failures are surfaced on stderr
in the form ``wispy: config error: <path>: <reason>`` and the process
exits with status 1 *before* any transport is constructed.

A request for a defined WSP method that the
loaded Config_File does not configure surfaces as ``-32601`` from the
dispatcher's normal method-not-found path; this entry point is
responsible only for registering whatever the Config_File asks for
plus the two lifecycle methods.

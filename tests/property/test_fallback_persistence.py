"""Property test for fallback Workflow_Tool persistence.

The built-in fallback Workflow_Tool is supposed to persist its set of
Environments across WSP_CLI invocations: every Environment created in
one invocation MUST remain listable, retrievable, executable, and
deletable in every subsequent invocation against the same state
directory until it is removed via ``environment/delete``.

This module models that property as a Hypothesis
:class:`~hypothesis.stateful.RuleBasedStateMachine` whose rules each
simulate a fresh CLI invocation:

1. Each rule constructs a brand-new :class:`HandlerRegistry` via
   :func:`~wispy.cli.fallback.make_fallback_registry`, pointing at a
   shared temp state directory. The previous registry is discarded;
   only on-disk state survives between rules. This is exactly what
   the spec calls "process restart" semantics.
2. Each rule performs at most one ``create`` or ``delete`` and runs
   ``list`` to verify the persisted set matches a shadow model.
3. The shadow model -- a plain ``dict[name, id]`` -- is the oracle:
   the persisted set of ``id`` values returned by ``environment/list``
   MUST always equal the multiset of ids in the shadow model.

``subprocess.run``, ``venv.EnvBuilder.create``, and ``shutil.which``
are stubbed so each rule completes in milliseconds and never spawns a
real interpreter. The on-disk state machinery (``index.json``, the
file lock) is the system under test; the venv contents are not.
